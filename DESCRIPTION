Description: Output products of the gcamdata package suitable for old/new comparison tests.
  This data is kept in a separate package as it is a sizeable data product
  and so we want users to only need to load it upon request. This also allows
  us to decouple this history (in order to keep the Git repository at a
  reasonable size) from the actual code development.
  Users can update the compdata by copying in from the \code{gcamdata/output}
  into \code{gcamdata.compdata/output}; then
  \code{source("data-raw/update-compdata.R")}.
  Users should avoid doing extended development on this package as we may choose to do maintenance on the history at any time.
